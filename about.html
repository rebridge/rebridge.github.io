            <h1>About</h1>
            <p> I'm Robby Bridges and I am currently a full-time college student in the
                field of computer science. Some of my biggest interests/hobbies are sports
                (specifically baseball), working on my 1990 F-150, and hanging out with friends.
            </p>
            <p> I also enjoy exprimenting with technology. This website is actually one of my first
                projects (started in May of 2020) and one of the many that I began
                as a result of quarantine enduced boredom.
